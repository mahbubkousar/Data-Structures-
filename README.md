# How to Master DSA

- Prioritize solving problems over theory.
- Challenge yourself with increasingly difficult problems.
- Understand the concepts, don’t just memorize them.
- Recognize and think in patterns.

## Must-Know DSA Topics for Interviews

### Grouped into Three Pillars:

#### Data Structures:

**Linear:**
- Arrays
- Linked Lists
- Stacks
- Queues
- Hash Tables

**Non-Linear:**
- Trees
  - Binary Trees
  - Binary Search Trees
- Heaps
- Graphs
- Trie
- Union-Find

#### Algorithms:
- Sorting (Bubble, Merge, Quick, Insertion, etc.)
- Binary Search
- Bit Manipulation
- Tree Traversal (In-order, Pre-order, Post-order, Level-order)
- Graph Traversal (BFS/DFS)
- Topological Sort
- Shortest Path Algorithms (Dijkstra’s, Bellman-Ford)

#### Problem-Solving Techniques:
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Prefix Sum
- Fast and Slow Pointers
- Divide and Conquer
- Greedy Algorithms
- Recursion
- Backtracking
- Dynamic Programming
- Top ‘K’ Elements
- Segment Tree
- Fenwick Tree

## Key Concepts:
- **Time and Space Complexity:** Understanding Big O notation is critical for analyzing the efficiency of algorithms.

## Approach to Learning:

1. **Ins and Outs:**
   - Understand the fundamental concepts.
   - How it’s represented in code.
   - Different operations you can perform on it.
   - Analyze Time/Space complexities.

2. **Implement from Scratch:**
   - Write the data structure and algorithm code from scratch to deepen understanding.

3. **Practice Problems:**
   - Start with LeetCode easy problems to build confidence.

4. **Right Order to Learn:**
   - Arrays → Linked List → Stack & Queues → Hash Tables → Two Pointers / Sliding Window → Recursion / Backtracking → Sorting → Searching → Bit Manipulation → Tree / BST / Trie → Heaps → Greedy → Dynamic Programming → Graph / Union Find

5. **Learning Steps:**
   - Start with Basics
     - What it is?
